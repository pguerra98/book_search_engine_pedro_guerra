## Description

In this bootcamp challenge, the main goal is to build a code that will display fully functionality of google books API search engine, while also working with a Restful
API. The code will be refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built utilizing the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database,
and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
